# Compare Decimals

Three drivers competed in a race. %`a=name_male()`%'s average speed was %`randint(144,145)`%.%`randint(100, 999)`% mph, %`name_female()`%'s average speed was %`randint(144,145)`%.%`randint(100, 999)`% mph, and %`c=name_female()`%'s average speed was %`randint(144,145)`%.%`randint(100, 999)`% mph. Order the speeds from least to greatest.

%`d=name_male()`% had a speed between %`a`% and %`c`%. Write a possible speed for %`d`%.

## Problem Solving

The total cost to stay one night at Sleepy Pig Motel is $%`a=randint(101, 150)`% without breakfast and $%`a+randint(20, 50)`% with breakfast included. What is the difference in the cost for a one-night stay with and without breakfast?

%`name_female()`% bought the least expensive brand of dog food. %`name_male()`% bought the most expensive brand of dog food. Which brand did each person buy? Brand A is $%`randint(10, 12)`%.%`randint(11, 99)`%, Brand B is $%`randint(10, 12)`%.%`randint(11, 99)`%, Brand C is $%`randint(10, 12)`%.%`randint(11, 99)`%, Brand D is $%`randint(10, 12)`%.%`randint(11, 99)`%.

[question]: <> (heights=uniq_decimals(4, 149, 153))

The heights of four boys measured %`heights[0]`% cm, %`heights[1]`% cm, %`heights[2]`% cm, and %`heights[3]`% cm. %`name_male()`% is the tallest. %`name_male()`% is taller than %`a=name_male()`% but shorter than %`b=name_male()`%. %`a`% is the shortest. What is %`b`%'s height?
