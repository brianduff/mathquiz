(@) Annalisa buys 17 pounds of strawberries. Each pound costs $5. If she gives the cashier five $20 dollar bills, how much change should she receive?

(@) Sander practiced soccer for 57 minutes. Leodora practiced for 2 times as long as Sander. How many minutes did Leodora practice? How many minutes in all did Sander and Leodora practice? Write an equation to model your work.

## Practice

### Choose all equations that are true.



(@) [ ] $10 \times 10 \times 10 = 3,000$
(@) [ ] $10 \times 10 \times 10 = 300$
(@) [ ] $10 \times 10 \times 10 = 1,000$
(@) [ ] $10 \times 10 \times 10 = 30$
(@) [ ] $10 \times 10 \times 10 = 10^3$

### Choose all equations that are true.


(@) [ ] $90,000,000 = 9 \times 1,000,000$
(@) [ ] $90,000,000 = 9 \times 10^6$
(@) [ ] $90,000,000 = 9 \times 10^8$
(@) [ ] $90,000,000 = 9 \times 10^7$
(@) [ ] $90,000,000 = 9 \times 10,000,000$
